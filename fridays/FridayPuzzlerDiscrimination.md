[This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/177mpcijcT1howTNwIzPTr5mzVDaUf84wPzfSQunjna4/edit?usp=sharing) represents actual data from a major university. It gives admission data for 6 graduate programs (A-F).   [link to the csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/data/graduate.csv)



**The question is simple, does this university discriminate based on sex for admissions?**

A good answer would contain text and supporting statistics.  This can be in the form of a Jupyter notebook, or a Google Doc.  I will give up to 5xp bonus for good use of Pandas if you go the notebook route. 



To submit, send me the link in a direct message to me in Slack.
